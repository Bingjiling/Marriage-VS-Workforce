WORKFLOW

0. Use merged data hp.RDS in data folder
0a. Incorporate survey weights using the survey package and svrepdesign()
1. Look at values 1 to 4 for variable FES, plot percentage charts, compare above and below median
1a. Redo the above and below median plots so that there are 3 bars in each category (Yanyu)
2. Do boxplots of median FINCP for FES = 2 (married couple, male in labor force) and FES = 3 (married couple, female in labor force)
3. Use FES as an indicator variable and take the mean of male in labor force = -1, both in labor force = 0, female in labor force = 1, and map
4. Compare industries (top 5?) for person in labor force for FES = 2 vs FES = 3
5. Take the difference of FINCP - PINCP for whoever is in the labor force for FES = 2 and FES = 3
5a. Plot the difference by diff levels of education
